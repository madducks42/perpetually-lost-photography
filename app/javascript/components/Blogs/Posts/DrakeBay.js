      <h1 className="is-size-1">Costa Rica - Drake Bay</h1>
      <p>It would be really hard for me to pick a favorite place so far in Costa Rica but Drake Bay would definitely be a top contender. While a popular destination, which to be fair every place in Costa Rica is a popular destination, Drake Bay is pretty remote and the hotels and resorts are scattered around so it doesn’t feel crowded or busy. While technically possible to drive to, it’s over a six hour drive from San Jose and the last part of this is on dirt roads and requires fording rivers. So you’re probably not going to do that in a rental car. When we went to Drake Bay we went back to San Jose and took a very small plane to Bahía Drake Airport which consists of a very small landing strip and a covered area for checking in/waiting for your flight. We thought it was fun but I can see how this might be tough if you have a fear of flying. After that it was a ten minute car ride, which did include fording a river, followed by a ten minute boat ride to the hotel. Most of the hotels in this area are easier to access by boat.</p>
      <p>We stayed at Aguila De Osa Inn and really enjoyed our stay. There are lots of nice places in the area but we’ll definitely be going back to Aguila De Osa Inn. We sprung for the Junior Suite room and it had an epic view of the bay. The restaurant/bar also overlooked the bay which made it a lovely place to hang out and relax. This hotel had kayaks we could use whenever we wanted to explore the channels that ran by the hotel, I’m guessing this is common for most of the hotels that are on the water. We saw a lot of wildlife this way and was one of the highlights of our trip.</p>
      <p>One of the major draws of this area is snorkeling/scuba diving in Cano Island. The snorkeling was really nice in this area, the water was clear and the reefs were very healthy and active with all kinds of fish. Most of the snorkeling tours will go to one of the nearby islands and setup lunch on the beach and then you have a couple hours to hang out on the beach before heading back. There are a couple different tour groups that do this in the area, usually you can book it from whatever hotel you’re staying at. It makes for a very nice day trip.</p>
      <p>The other major draw of this area is Corcovado National Park. This is the largest national park in Costa Rica and has a lot of biological diversity. We only spent one day here and it was spectacular. When we go back I’ll definitely dedicate couple days to exploring Corcovado. There are a couple different tour options and some of them do require somewhat strenuous hiking and will likely require you to cross creeks/rivers. If you book a tour make sure to read the description for what they recommend you wearing. This is the place where we’ve seen the most wildlife so if seeing wildlife is important to you then Drake Bay and Corcovado National Park should be on the top of your list.</p>
